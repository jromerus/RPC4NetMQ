# RPC4NetMQ


Very simple RPC wrapper around NetMQ ( c# 0MQ engine).


It uses Castle.Core to Intercept calls to client and server based on a user defined interface. The code is a port of [NetMQ.RPC](https://github.com/newstrading/NetMQ.RPC) from .NET to NET, wich is also based on [Burrow.NET](https://github.com/vanthoainguyen/Burrow.NET) (which does RPC via RabbitMQ).
